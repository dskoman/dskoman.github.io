### CPSC 120

* Lab 7

  Lab 5, part 2 is notable to me because I remember enjoying the problem solving process me and my partners took part in.
  We would understand the program from a purely logical standpoint, then translate that into code. Moments like this
  are important to remember as we moved on.
  
* Lab 10
  
  Lab 10, part 2 was interesting becaues it reminded me of a programming project that I worked on in high school; I was tasked with
  processing a table of IP addresses. Similarly in this lab, we worked with tables/2D vectors to organize information. 
  
* Lab 12

  Lab 8, part 1 was fun because of the ways we were able to manipulate graphics using code. We experimented with different algorithms
  for generating the gif, but eventually settled on the correct algorithm that generated the rainbow gradient. Programming in graphics
  is a subject I want to revisit at some point.
