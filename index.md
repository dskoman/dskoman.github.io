# Hello World

This is my home page! My name is Anthony Vasquez and I am a student at [Cal State Fullerton](https://www.fullerton.edu/) and my major is computer science.

### CPSC 120

* [Lab 7](https://github.com/cpsc-pilot-fall-2022/cpsc-120-lab-07-anthony-and-oscar)

  Lab 5, part 2 is notable to me because I remember enjoying the problem solving process me and my partners took part in.
  We would understand the program from a purely logical standpoint, then translate that into code, using functions to isolate each action in the game. Moments like this
  are important for us to remember as we moved on.

  Lab 10, part 2 was interesting becaues it reminded me of a programming project that I worked on in high school; I was tasked with
  processing a table of IP addresses. Similarly in this lab, we learned how to correctly access 2D vectors/tables based on user input. I can see skills
  like this being useful when dealing with things like statistics, where processing and searching through large amounts of information is common.

  Lab 8, part 1 was fun because of the ways we were able to manipulate graphics using code. This lab also showed me the relationship between math and programming through the use of trigonomic functions. Programming in graphics
  is a subject I want to revisit at some point.
